# Jammming React App

## Project from Codecademy's Frontend Engineer Career Path
### By Otoniel Mercado

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Outline 

Jammming is a React-based web application designed to facilitate music discovery using the Spotify Web API. Users can easily search for songs, artists, and albums, with the option to add selected tracks to a personalized playlist. Furthermore, they have the flexibility to rename the playlist and save it directly to their Spotify account for convenient access.
